    This is my second blog. Today, for the challenge, we as 
    class had to choose an object to draw. To draw the object,
    we used TinkerCad. For me, I chose to do a mini Bible as my
    object. I think I did pretty well but I sadly didn't win a 
    kitkat :/    But it's okay because I think I made it as detailed
    as possible :)

    This is my third blog. Today we made an E with super exact
    dimensions with it. I made my E with 36 inches as the height and 
    about 8 inches for the side parts. We had so switch with someone else
    to make our E for us and I had to make Ryan's. His was about 11 cm in
    height and about 6 cm for the sides. When I was done with Ryan's, I looked
    over to see mine and it was super huge. I was shocked by how big it was
    but it was a beautiful E :)

        This is my fourth blog. Today is 9/16/22 and we tried to make
        a boat float on top of the water. I was in group two and we made
        a failry acceptable boat but we soon found out unfortunately that
        it was way too small. We used four marbles to balance the boat out.
        When we got over there, our sank in about a minute but it group
        number four took it all home :(

            This is my fifth blog. This week we made a Rube Gold Berg
            machine and me and my team made a very cool design. Our 
            project was made with a car that Ryan brought in a string
            to hold the baseball. When we started to test out project,
            it fortuately worked on the first try. This made us very happy
            and me and my team were very excited because it worked.

                This is my sixth blog. Yesterdsay and Today, we were dissecting
                a laptop. It wasn't a chromebook however, but a big normal laptop
                As we were dissecting it, my team and I, Ryan and Linnea, had to 
                drop our screws into a small container so that we wouldn't lose them.
                We also had to color code what we saw on the two sheet layouts of
                the design that was given to each and everyone of us. After we took
                it apart with the help of the slides that was posted, we had to know
                go into reverse and put it all back together the same way we had 
                opened it.

                This is my seventh blog. This week, I had to create a 
                prosthetic for an animal of my choice. I obviously chose
                a crow because they are just simply better but I needed to create
                a wing to help it fly incase of an emergency. I chose to create
                two small solar-powered batteries to help the wing flap. I chose
                this because I thought it would be most efficient for the animal and
                the wing. And then, I needed to make a way for the wing to actually 
                attach to the crow so I thought about a small wing that would be plastic 
                and be attached by surgery to the crow so that it would not rust after years and cause infections to the crow.

                This is my eight blog. Today, our challenge statement was to 
                build a flying object out of paper. I chose an airplane because
                I think it would have been the easiest and most efficient way to do 
                it. Our goal was to go outside on to the second floor of the balcony
                and try to hit the trash can outside on the ground with out flying
                objects. I tried to make mine as aerodynamic as much as I could by 
                adding little flaps that would later on try to help to uplift my airplane
                as it lifts off into the air. Unfortunately however, I barely made it
                out of the balcony and it barely flew and then sank fastly to the ground 
                in around two seconds :(.

                    This is my eight blog. Today we tried to make a water filter
                    to try to clean the water as our challenge today. I was on group 6
                    and we made a pretty good one that was kind of yellow-ish but pretty
                    clean to be honest. I had a lot of fun when I did it with my group
                    together as a team. We also made it by using cotton first,m then sand
                    then small rocks, and then finally big rocks, going from bottomn to the top.

                    This is my ninth blog. Today we learned about electrical engineering,
                    which honestly was really cool and I cannot wait until we can get to
                    the hands-on portion of the course. We also had to do a worksheet which
                    was pretty easy which had to tie in a little with physics and it was 
                    really fun and I am very excited to start this course and I have good
                    feelings about it. :)

                This is my tenth blog. Today we lesrned how to make a bottle rocket
                and we went outside to the field right next to the 5000 building
                and set them off with pressure. With the help of the other engineering
                class we were able to make our rockets fly together. I had a lot of fun
                with this and hope we can do this again.

                this is my eleventh blog. Today we learned about circuts inside of 
                TinkerCad and it was really cool to see how circuits are formed and 
                how they use electricity to make light appear in a bulb. We tried this
                out with different types of batteries and each one had a differnt type
                of voltage. I had a lot of fun with this and it was a really cool 
                experience for me.

                This is my twelvth blog. Today we had a very hard but interesting
                challenge. This challenge was to choose between sitting in a math class
                for a whole year for 50 min a day for 180 days or count from 1 to 1,000,000
                without any breaks. This was very hard for me and everytime I thought
                that I had the answer, I was overthinking that I was missing something,
                and the truth was that I was. Even though the question and answer was 
                hard for my brain to wrap itself around, I still had lots of fun and I 
                really liked this challenge a lot.

            This is my thirteenth blog. Today, was a very fun Lab because
            we were able to get a laptop and circuits and LED bulbs and use 
            Arduino Programming to code on the laptop and make the LED bulbs 
            flicker in all different patterns and shapes. Honestly, this was 
            a very life changing and fun experience for me and I had so much fun 
            doing this with my teammate Linnea, and I can hope that we do something like
            this in the future again :).

        This is my first blog. This week, we were told to come up with a shark tank
        pitch that we can use to present. My group of 4 (including me) chose to make 
        a mathinator which is a advanced version of a calculator that lets you do complex
        math on it. Honestly, this project was very fun and I want to see more things like this
        soon. :))

            This is my second blog. This week we were told to make obleck, and
            it was actually very very fun. And I also got to work with Xavier because
            he was sitting right next to me. The whole point was to make something very cool
            which it was but it was also very messy too. But either way I really
            loved this project so much and would like to see it again in my future. :)

                Week 6 : Arduino Project Evaluation
                For this weeks project, me and my partner Xavier decided to push our selves
                and work on the Arduino car project. We ddecided to do this because I felt
                like we are able and that we have potential to atleast try and accomplish this
                project. To be honest, the project was really hard at first because we both knew
                nothing about how to code Arduino and we were scared that we would not be able to 
                do this assignment. But eventually we started to ask other groups who were doing the 
                same project as us and we got the hang of what had to be done in order to start and
                complete this project. We did definitely have many obstacles to get over including us 
                actually learning how to use the code correctly and put it into use. but overall, I think
                that this project was very good because it helped me and Xavier to learn new things about Arduino
                and a lot of life skills including teamwork and friendship. I liked doing this project a lot with my 
                partner Xavier Ponce and it was really fun to do this project with him.

            This is my Ninth blog ( Week Nine)
            This week we were able to do a challege involving a boat to be made with 
            chopsticks and other material like pipe cleaners, baloons, and rubber bands 
            to be helped to make the boat. In out project, we made our boat have a more
            aerodynamic shape to it by adding a cone shape at the front of the boat itself.
            The competition was to make the boat float for the longest in a gutter with water 
            filled up inside of it. Our went for about four feet and four inches. This for me, was actually 
            a lot more than I expected because I thought it would only go for about one foot and a few inches
            inside of the gutter. And honestly, I think that this was a very fun project and if I were able to do this
            again, I would probably make the boat more stable by adding more foundation on the bottom of the boat and maybe 
            A little more air on the baloon so that it goes for a longer distance.

            This is my tenth blog. (Week 10)
            This week we were told to make or atleast try to start a project which would 
            be an egg toss. We were told first to sketch out a good drawing of our egg box
            using the materials such as straws, popsicle sticks, carboard boxes, and carboard 
            and also baloons and bags such as normal ones or just trash bags too. I think that my 
            sketch was pretty good but I failed to think about the actual inside of the carboard box 
            and not just the outside because I did most of the protection on the outside. Overall, I am very 
            excited to see what this project brings me and my team and I am looking forward to it definiely. I can't wait for it.

        This is my eleventh blog.
        
        
        This week we were told to make and test out our egg drop projects. 
        I think that our project went really well because the egg did not crack at all in the layers that we put it in. 
        We wrapped our egg in newspaper and just regular paper in general. I think we did about 
        the same good job as other groups did because most of the groups’ eggs didn’t break at all either. Either way, 
        I think that our group had a very good play at this project and I really enjoyed doing this project.
