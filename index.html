    This is my second blog. Today, for the challenge, we as 
    class had to choose an object to draw. To draw the object,
    we used TinkerCad. For me, I chose to do a mini Bible as my
    object. I think I did pretty well but I sadly didn't win a 
    kitkat :/    But it's okay because I think I made it as detailed
    as possible :)

    This is my third blog. Today we made an E with super exact
    dimensions with it. I made my E with 36 inches as the height and 
    about 8 inches for the side parts. We had so switch with someone else
    to make our E for us and I had to make Ryan's. His was about 11 cm in
    height and about 6 cm for the sides. When I was done with Ryan's, I looked
    over to see mine and it was super huge. I was shocked by how big it was
    but it was a beautiful E :)

        This is my fourth blog. Today is 9/16/22 and we tried to make
        a boat float on top of the water. I was in group two and we made
        a failry acceptable boat but we soon found out unfortunately that
        it was way too small. We used four marbles to balance the boat out.
        When we got over there, our sank in about a minute but it group
        number four took it all home :(

            This is my fifth blog. This week we made a Rube Gold Berg
            machine and me and my team made a very cool design. Our 
            project was made with a car that Ryan brought in a string
            to hold the baseball. When we started to test out project,
            it fortuately worked on the first try. This made us very happy
            and me and my team were very excited because it worked.

                This is my sixth blog. Yesterdsay and Today, we were dissecting
                a laptop. It wasn't a chromebook however, but a big normal laptop
                As we were dissecting it, my team and I, Ryan and Linnea, had to 
                drop our screws into a small container so that we wouldn't lose them.
                We also had to color code what we saw on the two sheet layouts of
                the design that was given to each and everyone of us. After we took
                it apart with the help of the slides that was posted, we had to know
                go into reverse and put it all back together the same way we had 
                opened it.

                This is my seventh blog. This week, I had to create a 
                prosthetic for an animal of my choice. I obviously chose
                a crow because they are just simply better but I needed to create
                a wing to help it fly incase of an emergency. I chose to create
                two small solar-powered batteries to help the wing flap. I chose
                this because I thought it would be most efficient for the animal and
                the wing. And then, I needed to make a way for the wing to actually 
                attach to the crow so I thought about a small wing that would be plastic 
                and be attached by surgery to the crow so that it would not rust after years and cause infections to the crow.
