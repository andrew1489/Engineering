    This is my third blog. Today, for the challenge, we as 
    class had to choose an object to draw. To draw the object,
    we used TinkerCad. For me, I chose to do a mini Bible as my
    object. I think I did pretty well but I sadly didn't win a 
    kitkat :/    But it's okay because I think I made it as detailed
    as possible :)
